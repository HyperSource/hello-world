# hello-world
Former VBA dev who got tired of trying to pull of OOP in an event-driven language.  Currently funemployed and furthering my education of everything from front web to back-end, and all the Layers in between.  I won't contruibute to anything I don't think I know enough about...which means that I won't contribute much at this point.  VBA dev seems to be a dying industry.

If anyone is interested in "taking me under their wing", so to speak, that would be greatly appreciated.  I'd like to build relationships in the community, and contribute to open-source projects in the name of collaboration.

VBA, MSSQL, ASP.NET MVC, C#, Java

Happy coding!
