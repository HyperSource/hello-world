# hello-world
Former VBA dev who got tired of trying to pull of OOP in an event-driven language.  Currently funemployed and furthering my knowledge of everything from front-end to back-end, from client applications all the way down to the infrastructure layer.  I won't contruibute to anything I don't think I know enough about...which means that I won't contribute much at this point.  VBA devs seem to be a dying breed...legacy and all that.

If anyone is interested in "taking me under their wing", so to speak, that would be greatly appreciated.  I'd like to build relationships in the community, and contribute to open-source projects in the name of collaboration.

Proficient: VBA
Competent: HTML, CSS
Learning: MSSQL, ASP.NET MVC, C#, Java, JavaScript, PHP

Happy coding!
